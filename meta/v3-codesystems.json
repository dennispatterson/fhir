Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.<br/>\r\n\n                        Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.<br/>\r\n\n                        One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who &quot;owns&quot; the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.<br/>\r\n\n                        In this sense, an Act-instance represents a &quot;statement&quot; according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but &quot;a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done.&quot; Rector and Nowlan go on saying that &quot;the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view.&quot; Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.<br/>\r\n\n                        Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as &quot;speech-acts&quot; in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].<br/>\r\n\n                        An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category &quot;sequel&quot;).<br/>\r\n\n                        Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent &quot;objective state of affairs&quot; or &quot;real processes&quot; independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>2<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color: grey\"><i>(_ActClassRecordOrganizer)<\/i><\/span><\/td><td><a name=\"_ActClassRecordOrganizer\">&nbsp;<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Used to group a set of acts sharing a common context.

There are case definitions for conditions that are reportable, as well as for those that are not.

As a result, several patients have been exposed to very high levels of detergents still present in the &quot;clean&quot; bedding, and have experienced dermatological reactions to this. <br/>\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There has been an incident with multiple exposures to several patients.

After several months of various tests having been performed and various medications prescribed to these patients, the problem is traced to their being &quot;sensitive&quot; to a new fungicide used in the wall plaster of the ward where these patients reside.<br/>\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    The patients have been continuously exposed to the fungicide.

His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use.  Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice.  Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought.  The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring. <br/>\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    There is a substance administration with an associated exposure.

The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve.  The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.  Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place. <br/>\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is a procedural sequelae.

In their haste, the patient slips in the puddle and falls so badly that they have to be taken to the A&amp;E department, where it is discovered on investigation they have slightly torn the cruciate ligament in their left knee. <br/>\r\n\n                              \n                                 \n                                    This is not an exposure.

The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The code attribute of Observation and the value attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion:\n                        <br/>\r\n\n                        Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a  variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.<br/>\r\n\n                        As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. <br/>\r\n\n                        The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.<br/>\r\n\n                        An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.<br/>\r\n\n                        Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. <br/>\r\n\n                        Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations.

Typically the bounded dimension is continuous, and so the Observation.value will be an interval (IVL) data type. The Observation.value need not be specified if the respective dimension is only named but not constrained.

Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.\r\n\n                        Acts connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.\r\n\n                        One of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who \"owns\" the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.\r\n\n                        In this sense, an Act-instance represents a \"statement\" according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) [Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.]  Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but \"a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done.\" Rector and Nowlan go on saying that \"the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view.\" Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.\r\n\n                        Rector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as \"speech-acts\" in linguistics and philosophy.  The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) [How to do things with words. Oxford University Press].\r\n\n                        An activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle.  This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category \"sequel\").\r\n\n                        Act as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent \"objective state of affairs\" or \"real processes\" independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information."},"concept":[{"code":{"value":"_ActClassRecordOrganizer"},"abstract":{"value":true},"display":{"value":"record organizer"},"definition":{"value":"Used to group a set of acts sharing a common context.

The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment.  At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass.  A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity.

The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The code attribute of Observation and the value attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion:\n                        \r\n\n                        Structurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a  variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.\r\n\n                        As with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects. \r\n\n                        The method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.\r\n\n                        An observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.\r\n\n                        Even though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC. \r\n\n                        Clinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation. \r\n\n                        \n                           Examples:\n                        \r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              Recording the results of a Family History Assessment\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Laboratory test and associated result\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Physical exam test and associated result\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Device temperature\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Soil lead level"},"concept":[{"code":{"value":"_ActClassROI"},"abstract":{"value":true},"display":{"value":"ActClassROI"},"definition":{"value":"Regions of Interest (ROI) within a subject Act.

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions.  The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly.  A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss.  An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer.  A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion: In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy.  The policy holder may be the covered party, a relative of the covered party, a partnership, or a corporation, e.g., an employer.  A subscriber of a self-insured health insurance policy is a policy holder.  A subscriber of an employer sponsored health insurance policy is holds a certificate of coverage, but is not a policy holder; the policy holder is the employer.

Health insurance is typically administered in accordance with a plan, which specifies (1) the type of health services and health conditions that will be covered under what circumstances (e.g., exclusion of a pre-existing condition, service must be deemed medically necessary; service must not be experimental; service must provided in accordance with a protocol; drug must be on a formulary; service must be prior authorized; or be a referral from a primary care provider); (2) the type and affiliation of providers (e.g., only allopathic physicians, only in network, only providers employed by an HMO); (3) financial participations required of covered parties (e.g., co-pays, coinsurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket); and (4) the manner in which services will be paid (e.g., under indemnity or fee-for-service health plans, the covered party typically pays out-of-pocket and then file a claim for reimbursement, while health plans that have contractual relationships with providers, i.e., network providers, typically do not allow the providers to bill the covered party for the cost of the service until after filing a claim with the payer and receiving reimbursement).<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DENTAL<\/td><td><a name=\"DENTAL\">dental care policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that that covers benefits for dental services.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISEASE<\/td><td><a name=\"DISEASE\">disease specific policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that covers benefits for healthcare services provided for named conditions under the policy, e.g., cancer, diabetes, or HIV-AIDS.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DRUGPOL<\/td><td><a name=\"DRUGPOL\">drug policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that covers benefits for prescription drugs, pharmaceuticals, and supplies.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EHCPOL<\/td><td><a name=\"EHCPOL\">extended healthcare<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Private insurance policy that provides coverage in addition to other policies (e.g. in addition to a Public Healthcare insurance policy).<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HIP<\/td><td><a name=\"HIP\">health insurance plan policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A health insurance policy that covers healthcare benefits by protecting covered parties from medical expenses arising from health conditions, sickness, or accidental injury as well as preventive care.

Managed care uses medical protocols and procedures agreed on by the medical profession to be cost effective, also known as medical practice guidelines. Providers are typically reimbursed for covered services by a capitated amount on a per member per month basis that may reflect difference in the health status and level of services anticipated to be needed by the member.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>5<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;POS<\/td><td><a name=\"POS\">point of service policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A policy for a health plan that has features of both an HMO and a FFS plan.

In return, the policyholder agrees to pay a stipulated amount called a premium at regular intervals.  Life insurance indemnifies the beneficiary for the loss of the insurable interest that a beneficiary has in the life of a covered party.  For persons related by blood, a substantial interest established through love and affection, and for all other persons, a lawful and substantial economic interest in having the life of the insured continue. An insurable interest is required when purchasing life insurance on another person. Specific exclusions are often written into the contract to limit the liability of the insurer; for example claims resulting from suicide or relating to war, riot and civil commotion.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion:A life insurance policy may be used by the covered party as a source of health care coverage in the case of  a viatical settlement, which is the sale of a life insurance policy by the policy owner, before the policy matures. Such a sale, at a price discounted from the face amount of the policy but usually in excess of the premiums paid or current cash surrender value, provides the seller an immediate cash settlement. Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face. Some people are also familiar with life settlements, which are similar transactions but involve insureds with longer life expectancies (two to fifteen years).<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANNU<\/td><td><a name=\"ANNU\">annuity policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A policy that, after an initial premium or premiums, pays out a sum at pre-determined intervals.<br/>\r\n\n                        For example, a policy holder may pay $10,000, and in return receive $150 each month until he dies; or $1,000 for each of 14 years or death benefits if he dies before the full term of the annuity has elapsed.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TLIFE<\/td><td><a name=\"TLIFE\">term life insurance policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: Life insurance under which the benefit is payable only if the insured dies during a specified period.

Individuals and corporations obtain insurance policies to provide protection for various risks (hurricanes, earthquakes, lawsuits, collisions, sickness and death, etc.). Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.<br/>\r\n\n                        For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs. An insurance company issuing an automobile liability policy, with a limit of $100,000 per accident may reinsure its liability in excess of $10,000. A fire insurance company which issues a large policy generally reinsures a portion of the risk with one or several other companies. Also called risk control insurance or stop-loss insurance.\n                        <br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>3<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SURPL<\/td><td><a name=\"SURPL\">surplus line insurance policy<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: \n                        <br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              A risk or part of a risk for which there is no normal insurance market available.<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              Insurance written by unauthorized insurance companies.

Programs are typically established or permitted by legislation with provisions for ongoing government oversight.  Regulations may mandate the structure of the program, the manner in which it is funded and administered, covered benefits, provider types, eligibility criteria and financial participation. A government agency may be charged with implementing the program in accordance to the regulation.  Risk of loss under a program in most cases would not meet what an underwriter would consider an insurable risk, i.e., the risk is not random in nature, not financially measurable, and likely requires subsidization with government funds.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion: Programs do not have policy holders or subscribers.  Program eligibles are enrolled based on health status, statutory eligibility, financial status, or age.  Program eligibles who are covered parties under the program may be referred to as members, beneficiaries, eligibles, or recipients.  Programs risk are underwritten by not for profit organizations such as governmental entities, and the beneficiaries typically do not pay for any or some portion of the cost of coverage.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description:  Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles.  A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy).   These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine.  A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy.  When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information.  This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Usage Note: Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements.  For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly.  Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly.  The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color: grey\"><i>(_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy)<\/i><\/span><\/td><td><a name=\"_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy\">&nbsp;<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.

Insurance, in law and economics, is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of potential financial loss. Insurance is defined as the equitable transfer of the risk of a potential loss, from one entity to another, in exchange for a premium and duty of care. A policy holder is an individual or an organization enters into a contract with an underwriter which stipulates that, in exchange for payment of a sum of money (a premium), one or more covered parties (insureds) is guaranteed compensation for losses resulting from certain perils under specified conditions.  The underwriter analyzes the risk of loss, makes a decision as to whether the risk is insurable, and prices the premium accordingly.  A policy provides benefits that indemnify or cover the cost of a loss incurred by a covered party, and may include coverage for services required to remediate a loss.  An insurance policy contains pertinent facts about the policy holder, the insurance coverage, the covered parties, and the insurer.  A policy may include exemptions and provisions specifying the extent to which the indemnification clause cannot be enforced for intentional tortious conduct of a covered party, e.g., whether the covered parties are jointly or severably insured.\r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion: In contrast to programs, an insurance policy has one or more policy holders, who own the policy.

Generally, viatical settlements involve insured individuals with a life expectancy of less than two years. In countries without state-subsidized healthcare and high healthcare costs (e.g. United States), this is a practical way to pay extremely high health insurance premiums that severely ill people face.

Reinsurers, in turn, provide insurance to insurance companies.\r\n\n                        For example, an HMO may purchase a reinsurance policy to protect itself from losing too much money from one insured's particularly expensive health care costs.

(Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description:  Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles.  A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy).   These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine.  A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy.  When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information.  This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.\r\n\n                        \n                           Usage Note: Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements.  For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly.  Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly.  The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title."},"concept":[{"code":{"value":"_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy"},"abstract":{"value":true},"display":{"value":"ActInformationSensitivityPolicy"},"definition":{"value":"Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.

In practice, however, this distinction has no general functional value in the inter-operation of health care computing.  &quot;Orders&quot; are commonly refused for a variety of clinical and business reasons, and the notion of a &quot;request&quot; obligates the recipient (the fulfiller) to respond to the sender (the author).  Indeed, in many regions, including Australia and Europe, the common term used is &quot;request.&quot;<br/>\r\n\n                        Thus, the concept embodies both notions, as there is no useful distinction to be made.  If a mandate is to be associated with a request, this will be embodied in the &quot;local&quot; business rules applied to the transactions.  Should HL7 desire to provide a distinction between these in the future, the individual concepts could be added as specializations of this concept.<br/>\r\n\n                        The critical distinction here, is the difference between this concept and an &quot;intent&quot;, of which it is a specialization.  An intent involves decisions by a single party, the author.  A request, however, involves decisions by two parties, the author and the fulfiller, with an obligation on the part of the fulfiller to respond to the request indicating that the fulfiller will indeed fulfill the request.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>4<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRP<\/td><td><a name=\"PRP\">proposal<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Definition: A suggestion that an act might be performed.

This expresses that one might not have realized a symptom if it would not be a common manifestation of a known condition.

The federal standards do not conceptually define ethnicity, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for ethnicity classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that ethnicity is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with a particular ethnicity is preferred to observer identification.  The standards specify two minimum ethnicity categories: Hispanic or Latino, and Not Hispanic or Latino.  The standards define a Hispanic or Latino as a person of &quot;Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, South or Central America, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.&quot; The standards stipulate that ethnicity data need not be limited to the two minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.  In addition, the standards stipulate that an individual can be Hispanic or Latino or can be Not Hispanic or Latino, but cannot be both.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>ExposureMode<\/td><td><a name=\"ExposureMode\">ExposureMode<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Code for the mechanism by which the exposure agent was exchanged or potentially exchanged by the participants involved in the exposure.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>FDDC<\/td><td><a name=\"FDDC\">First DataBank Drug Codes<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        National Drug Data File.

Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.<br/>\r\n\n                        Taken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.<br/>\r\n\n                        As well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.<br/>\r\n\n                        The RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.<br/>\r\n\n                        ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary. Therefore Terms that are directly authorized by the RDD Registration Authority neither define nor prescribe intellectual property rights or other legal entities.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>ISO3166-1<\/td><td><a name=\"ISO3166-1\">ISO 3166 2 Character Country Codes<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Two character country codes<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>ISO3166-2<\/td><td><a name=\"ISO3166-2\">ISO 3166 3 Character Country Codes<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Three character country codes<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>ISO3166-3<\/td><td><a name=\"ISO3166-3\">ISO 3166 Numeric country Codes<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Numeric country codes<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>ISO4217<\/td><td><a name=\"ISO4217\">ISO4217<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        ISO 4217 currency code<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>IUPC<\/td><td><a name=\"IUPC\">IUPAC/IFCC Component Codes<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Codes used by IUPAC/IFF to identify the component (analyte) measured.

For example, the symptom of &quot;difficulty breathing&quot; is placed in the terminological hierarchy as a subsidiary (or &quot;child&quot;) finding of &quot;pulmonary symptoms&quot; although the presence (or absence) of difficulty breathing can related to conditions as diverse as myocardial infarction, bronchitis, pharyngeal foreign bodies, asthma, pulmonary embolism, etc.  MEDCIN's diagnostic index provides more than 800 such links for difficulty breathing.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>MediaType<\/td><td><a name=\"MediaType\">MediaType<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Mime Media Types<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>MEDR<\/td><td><a name=\"MEDR\">Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Affairs (MEDRA)<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Dr. Louise Wood, Medicines Control Agency, Market Towers, 1 Nine Elms Lane, London SW85NQ, UK   Tel: (44)0 171-273-0000 WWW:  http://www.open.gov.uk/mca/mcahome.htm<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>1<\/td><td>MEDX<\/td><td><a name=\"MEDX\">Medical Economics Diagnostic Codes<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        Used for drug-diagnosis interaction checking.

The NMMDS is composed of seventeen (17) data elements organized into three categories: environment, nurse resources, and financial resources.  See Tables 1-3 for the elements and related definitions organized by each categories.  The NMMDS most appropriately focuses at the first level of accountability for patient/client/family/community nursing care: this may be the delivery unit, service, or center of excellence level.  The NMMDS supports numerous constructed variables as well as aggregation of data at the unit, institution, network, and system, etc levels.

The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from &quot;the original peoples&quot; of a specified region or nation.  The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.

Annex A specifies the methodology for and structure of the RDD Dictionary, and specifies how further Terms may be defined under the governance of a Registration Authority, requirements for which are described in Annex C.\r\n\n                        Taken together, these specifications and the RDD Dictionary and Database make up the RDD System. Use of the RDD System will facilitate the accurate exchange and processing of information between interested parties involved in the administration of rights in, and use of, Digital Items, and in particular it is intended to support ISO/IEC 21000-5 (REL). Clause 6 describes how ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 relates to ISO/IEC 21000-5.\r\n\n                        As well as providing definitions of terms for use in ISO/IEC 21000-5, the RDD System is designed to support the mapping of terms from different namespaces. Such mapping will enable the transformation of metadata from the terminology of one namespace (or Authority) into that of another namespace. Mapping, to ensure minimum ambiguity or loss of semantic integrity, will be the responsibility of the Registration Authority. Provision of automated trm look-up is also a requirement.\r\n\n                        The RDD Dictionary is a prescriptive dctionary, in the sense that it defines a single meaning for a trm represented by a particular RddAuthorized TermName, but it is also inclusive in that it can recognize the prescription of other Headwords and definitions by other Authorities and incorporates them through mappings. The RDD Dictionary also supports the circumstance that the same name may have different meanings under different Authorities. ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004describes audit provisions so that additions, amendments and deletions to Terms and their attributes can be tracked.\r\n\n                        ISO/IEC 21000-6:2004 recognizes legal definitions as and only as Terms from other Authorities that can be mapped into the RDD Dictionary.

Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from &quot;the original peoples&quot; of a specified region or nation.  The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.  The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories.<br/>\r\n\n

used by federal agencies and exert a strong influence on categorization by state and local agencies and private sector organizations.  The federal standards do not conceptually define race, and they recognize the absence of an anthropological or scientific basis for racial classification.  Instead, the federal standards acknowledge that race is a social-political construct in which an individual's own identification with one more race categories is preferred to observer identification. The standards use a variety of features to define five minimum race categories. Among these features are descent from \"the original peoples\" of a specified region or nation.  The minimum race categories are American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.  The federal standards stipulate that race data need not be limited to the five minimum categories, but any expansion must be collapsible to those categories."},"status":{"value":"active"},"date":{"value":"2013-03-11"},"define":{"system":{"value":"http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/Race"},"caseSensitive":{"value":true},"concept":[{"code":{"value":"1002-5"},"display":{"value":"American

The claims adjuster for the policy underwriter will review the claim to determine whether the loss meets the benefit coverage criteria under a policy, and base any indemnification or coverage payment on that review.  If a third party is liable in whole or part for the loss, the underwriter may pursue third party liability recovery.  A claimant may be involved in civil or criminal legal proceedings involving claims against a defendant party that is indemnified by an insurance policy or to protest the finding of a claims adjustor. With respect to life insurance, a beneficiary designated by a named insured becomes a claimant of the proceeds of coverage, as in the case of a life insurance policy.  However, a claimant for coverage under life insurance is not necessarily a designated beneficiary.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Note: A claimant is not a named insured.  However, a named insured may make a claim under a policy, e.g., an insured driver may make a claim for an injury under his or her comprehensive automobile insurance policy.  Similarly, a program eligible may make a claim under program, e.g., an unemployed worker may claim benefits under an unemployment insurance program, but parties playing these covered party role classes are not, for purposes of this vocabulary and in an effort to clearly distinguish role classes, considered claimants.<br/>\r\n\n                        In the case of a named insured making a claim, a role type code INSCLM (insured claimant) subtypes the class to indicate that either a named insured or an individual insured has filed a claim for a loss.  In the case of a program eligible, a role type code INJWKR (injured worker) subtypes the class to indicate that the covered party in a workers compensation program is an injured worker, and as such, has filed a &quot;claim&quot; under the program for benefits.  Likewise, a covered role type code UNEMP (unemployed worker) subtypes the program eligible class to indicate that the covered party in an unemployment insurance program has filed a claim for unemployment benefits.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Example: A claimant under automobile policy that is not the named insured.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>6<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NAMED<\/td><td><a name=\"NAMED\">named insured<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Description: A role played by a party to an insurance policy to which the insurer agrees to indemnify for losses, provides benefits for, or renders services.

For example, a policy holder may dictate the criteria for the dependent status of adult children who are students, such as requiring full time enrollment, or may recognize domestic partners as dependents.  Under certain circumstances, the dependent may be under the indirect authority of a responsible party acting as a surrogate for the subscriber, for example, if the subscriber is differently abled or deceased, a guardian ad Lidem or estate executor may be appointed to assume the subscriberaTMs legal standing in the relationship with the dependent.<br/>\r\n\n                     <\/td><\/tr>\r\n <tr><td>7<\/td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INDIV<\/td><td><a name=\"INDIV\">individual<\/a><\/td><td>\n                        \n                           Description: A role played by a party covered under a policy as the policy holder.
