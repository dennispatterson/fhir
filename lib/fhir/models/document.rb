# A documentation of healthcare-related information that is
# assembled together into a single statement of meaning that
# establishes its own context. A document is composed of a set
# of resources that include both human and computer readable
# portions. A human may attest to the accuracy of the human
# readable portion and may authenticate and/or sign the entire
# whole. A document may be kept as a set of logically linked
# resources, or they may be bundled together in an atom feed.
